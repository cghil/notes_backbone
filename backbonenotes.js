// to create a model class

// to start displaying the data

var appointmentView = new AppointmentView({ model: appointment}); // to create a view instance

// data --> models (provides the data) --> views (start to build the html)--> dom

// rendering the view
// 1. we first need to define render
// 2. we do this by going to our view class and define rendering there

var AppointmentView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function(){
    var html = '<li>'+this.model.get('title')+'</li>'; // i believe this refers to the instance of the model (appointment if it is called on appointment)
    // in the rendering function make sure to tell it where to render. I will be using JQUERY to make these methods easy.
    $(this.el).html(html);

//Backbone Models
// to get an attribute
appointment.get('title') //in this case it will be the 'I have an instance of appointment'
// to set an attribute
appointment.set({title: 'backbone needs to be checked'})

appointment.save();

// to render the appointmentView instance make sure to call the render function

// our appointment model isn't too useful... lets set some default attributes

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({

      title: 'Checkup',
      date: new Date(); // we make this a function to change the date. if it was written as an obj literal, we get every date the same. when the creation of the model happened
    }
  }

// thus far we have been instantiating the model via object literals and have had not restful routing.

// lets start to instantiate real data from a route.

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({urlRoot: '/appointments'});

// lets make a apt
var appointment = new Appointment({id: 1})

appointment.fetch(); // get all information on apt

appointment.set({description: 'Funny Bone Hurts'}) //update

appointment.save(); // put /todos/1 with json params


// Collections in the view

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({}); //  model class

var AppointmentList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Appointment // this tells the collection to include instance of the model (Appointment) inside the collection
});

var appointments = new AppointmentList(); // makes an instance of the collection

var AppointmentListView = Backbone.View.extend({}) // view class for the collection

var appointmentListView = new AppointmentListView{ collection: appointments} // noticed that we are passing the instance of our collections.

// Creating a route

// this is a call for the router
var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {'appointments/:id': 'show'},
  show: function(id){
    console.log('hello we are in the show with id %d', id);
  }

})

// Start the history using push state
Backbone.history.start({pushState: true}); // works with IE 10 or above

var router = new AppRouter();

// this is saving the history. to call it using the dom. Use window.history.back();
// Navigate: Whenever you reach a point in your application that you'd like to save as a URL, 
// call navigate in order to update the url.

router.navigate('appointments/1', { trigger: true});
